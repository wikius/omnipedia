Understood. Since the tool provides **instant feedback** to writers as they compose their articles, the requirements should be comprehensive and structured to facilitate real-time evaluation. Here are additional elements that the requirements could contain to enhance the tool's effectiveness:

---

### **1. Specific Error Messages and Suggestions**

**Purpose:** Provide clear, actionable feedback when a writer deviates from the guidelines.

**Implementation:**

- **Error Codes and Messages:** Each requirement can include specific error codes and corresponding messages that explain the issue and suggest corrections.
- **Examples:**

  ```json
  {
    "requirementId": "req_004",
    "description": "Implement gene nomenclature standards according to HUGO.",
    "actions": [
      {
        "actionType": "standardize_gene_nomenclature",
        "parameters": {
          "abbreviations": "...",
          "errorMessages": {
            "incorrectCapitalization": "Gene names for human genes should be in all capitals (e.g., ALDOA).",
            "missingItalics": "Gene symbols should be formatted in italic font."
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

---

### **2. Highlighting Rules and Severity Levels**

**Purpose:** Differentiate between minor and major compliance issues to help writers prioritize corrections.

**Implementation:**

- **Severity Levels:** Assign severity levels (e.g., "warning," "error," "critical") to each requirement.
- **Highlighting Styles:** Define how the tool should visually indicate each severity level (e.g., underline for warnings, red text for errors).

---

### **3. Dynamic Guidance for Incomplete Sections**

**Purpose:** Recognize that writers may draft sections in stages and provide appropriate feedback for incomplete content.

**Implementation:**

- **Placeholder Detection:** Guidelines for handling placeholders or notes within the text (e.g., "[Insert function here]").
- **Section Prompts:** Encourage writers to include all required sections, perhaps with reminders if a section is missing.

---

### **4. Integration with Editor Features**

**Purpose:** Leverage the editor's capabilities to provide non-intrusive, helpful assistance.

**Implementation:**

- **Tooltips:** Include brief explanations that appear when hovering over highlighted text.
- **Inline Suggestions:** Offer corrections or suggestions directly within the text, possibly with the option to accept changes automatically.

---

### **5. Examples of Correct and Incorrect Usage**

**Purpose:** Help writers understand expectations through concrete examples.

**Implementation:**

- **Within Requirements:** Each requirement can include "Do" and "Don't" examples.
- **Quick Reference:** Create a summary of common mistakes and correct practices.

---

### **6. Checklists and Progress Indicators**

**Purpose:** Allow writers to track their compliance with the guidelines as they write.

**Implementation:**

- **Checklist Items:** Break down requirements into checklist items that can be marked as completed.
- **Progress Bar:** Show overall compliance progress to motivate completion.

---

### **7. Style Metrics Monitoring**

**Implementation:**

- **Metrics to Monitor:**
  - **Sentence Length:** Flag overly long sentences.
  - **Passive Voice Usage:** Encourage active voice where appropriate.
  - **Jargon Density:** Identify excessive use of technical terms without explanation.
- **Thresholds:** Define acceptable ranges for each metric.

---

### **8. Accessibility and Readability Checks**

**Purpose:** Ensure the article is accessible to a wide audience, including those with disabilities.

**Implementation:**

- **Alt Text for Images:** Require descriptions for images.
- **Heading Structure:** Check for proper use of headings and subheadings.
- **Contrast Ratios:** Ensure text color contrasts meet accessibility standards.
