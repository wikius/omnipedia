    "content": "The GRIA2 gene encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 2, commonly referred to as GluA2, which is a critical component of AMPA receptors. These receptors are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The GluA2 protein plays a pivotal role in determining the ion permeability and conductance properties of AMPA receptors, particularly through RNA editing that affects calcium ion permeability (Priya2014Nuclear; Isaac2007The). Structurally, GluA2 forms a tetrameric assembly with other subunits, contributing to the receptor's 'Y'-shaped architecture, which is essential for its function in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission (Twomey2017Channel). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions with auxiliary subunits are crucial for the receptor's trafficking and function, impacting processes such as learning and memory (Chen2014Interaction; Schwenk2012HighResolution). Mutations in GRIA2 have been linked to various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Salpietro2019AMPA; Capauto2018A).",

    "content": "The GRIA2 gene encodes the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors, which are critical for fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. GluA2 plays a pivotal role in determining the physiological properties of AMPA receptors, such as ion permeability and conductance. A key feature of GluA2 is its RNA editing, which converts a glutamine to an arginine in the pore-forming region, rendering GluA2-containing receptors less permeable to calcium ions (Ca2+). This modification is crucial for reducing the risk of excitotoxicity, a condition caused by excessive Ca2+ entry into neurons (Priya2014Nuclear; Isaac2007The).\n\nGluA2 is involved in synaptic plasticity, including processes like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are essential for learning and memory. The subunit's presence influences receptor kinetics and single-channel conductance, impacting synaptic transmission and plasticity (Priya2014Specificity; Isaac2007The). In neurons, GluA2-containing AMPA receptors exhibit low Ca2+ permeability, while those lacking GluA2 are more permeable to Ca2+ and have higher conductance, affecting synaptic function and plasticity (Isaac2007The). The expression of GluA2 is regulated by transcription factors such as NRF-1 and Sp4, linking neuronal activity to energy metabolism and maintaining proper neuronal function (Priya2014Nuclear; Priya2014Specificity).",

These include intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, Rett syndrome-like features, and developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (Salpietro2019AMPA). Specific mutations, such as p.Q607E and p.A639S, have been linked to severe clinical phenotypes, including epileptic encephalopathy and sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) (Salpietro2019AMPA).\n\nThe GRIA2 gene is highly constrained for missense variations and intolerant to loss of function, indicating its critical role in protein stability and function (Cai2022Novel). De novo variants in GRIA2 can lead to haploinsufficiency, contributing to the phenotypic spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, which often manifest in childhood with symptoms such as developmental delay, speech impairment, and seizures (Salpietro2019AMPA).\n\nAlterations in GRIA2 expression have also been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), particularly in the context of FUS mutations, which are known to downregulate GRIA2 expression in motor neurons (Capauto2018A).
