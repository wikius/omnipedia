    "content": "The APRT gene encodes the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, which plays a pivotal role in the purine salvage pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a phosphoribosyltransferase and is responsible for converting adenine into adenosine monophosphate (AMP) using 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) as a substrate. The enzyme's activity is crucial for recycling adenine, thereby preventing its accumulation and subsequent conversion into 2,8-dihydroxyadenine, a compound that can lead to kidney stone formation if not properly managed (Silva2004ThreeDimensional; Hidaka1987Human). Structurally, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase is a homodimer with a conserved type I phosphoribosyltransferase fold, and its function is regulated by a dynamic catalytic loop (Silva2004ThreeDimensional; Huyet2018Structural). Mutations in the APRT gene can result in adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency, a condition that can lead to severe renal complications if left untreated (Edvardsson2013Hereditary; BearaLasic2011Genetic).",

    "content": "The human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) enzyme is a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of nine \u00ce\u00b2-strands and six \u00ce\u00b1-helices. The structure is divided into core, hood, and flexible loop domains. The core domain features a conserved type I phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase) fold, which is common among enzymes in this family (Silva2004ThreeDimensional). The hood domain includes two \u00ce\u00b1-helices and two \u00ce\u00b2-strands, while the flexible loop is characterized by a 'calyx-like' feature at the dimerization interface (Silva2004ThreeDimensional).\n\nThe active site of APRT accommodates the AMP product and is crucial for its catalytic function. Specific residues, such as Leu159 and Ala131, are responsible for the base specificities of type I PRTases (Silva2004ThreeDimensional). The enzyme's structure lacks a magnesium ion, which is typically important in the catalytic mechanism of PRTases, but a chloride ion is identified near R87 (Silva2004ThreeDimensional).\n\nThe enzyme's catalytic mechanism involves oxacarbenium transition states, with Glu104 playing a role in the deprotonation of the adenine N9 atom, facilitating the attack on the PRPP ribose C1 atom (Silva2008Structural).",

    "content": "Mutations in the APRT gene lead to adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts adenine metabolism.

If untreated, this condition can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Edvardsson2013Hereditary; BearaLasic2011Genetic).\n\nAPRT deficiency is characterized by the formation of radiolucent kidney stones, recurrent urinary tract infections, hematuria, and reddish-brown diaper stains in children. Many affected individuals remain asymptomatic, and the condition is often diagnosed through routine urine microscopy or sibling screening. In adults, ESRD due to crystalline nephropathy is a more common presentation, sometimes only recognized after kidney transplantation (Edvardsson2013Hereditary).\n\nThe disorder is more prevalent in Japan, France, and Iceland, with specific mutations such as the APRT\\*J allele being common in the Japanese population. Genetic testing and early recognition are crucial for preventing kidney failure, as the condition is often underdiagnosed due to a lack of awareness among clinicians (Kuno2004Comparison; Kamatani1992Only).",
